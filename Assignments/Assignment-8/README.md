PROBLEM STATEMENT
Hi, below are the catchup assignments for midterm and quiz and attendance. the deadline is may 24.

Please organize all the colabs in proper directories in a parent directory and write proper read.me for each of the assignment tellign what you did different from the colab code in hint very clearly. it is very important to provide this so we can validate you customized colab (either data or dataset or examples et.c,.)

 

please ensure you have proper titles in directory structure in directory names 

 

Add a parent read.me which points to all the colabs subdiretories handy way

We are strictly running turnit in - since this is an individual assignment and if a group of students jointly submit same colabs we will remove points from all the group.

 

note that turnit in will be used for these assignments to ensure students do not verbatim copy paste and actually come up with innovative examples 

All below are all colab deliveries in tensorflow/pytorch/huggingface/jax (you can choose). Ensure each of it is proper colab with proper read.me file. each colab - the output run saved should be checked into github - not just the some random not running colab.

Part 1-  Keras CV for image classification - total points 30

a) classificaton with keras CV

a.i) trasfer learning (direct inference)

a.ii) fine tuning

a.iii) image classifier from scratch

b) User KerasCV for  various image object detection tasks

b.i) Transfer learn from  pretrained models, custom object model detection, use stable diffusion v2,  

c) Try various image augmentations with keras and show A/B with and without augmentation performance

Hint: check the tensorflow.org slides on colabs in my slide deck in slide section starting https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UxtHDwjViC7VpSb0zB-kajGQ-TwznQmc-7LsbHRfO3s/edit#slide=id.g24036aab941_0_148Links to an external site.

Note: all above should not be exact replicas of colabs. you should try your own example data sets - if you copy paste what isthere in colab it will be counted zero marks for that point.
